    # ATTENTION: The example provided below is strictly for demonstration purposes and should NOT be deployed in a production environment.
    # It's crucial to develop and integrate your own robust authorization mechanism tailored to your application's security requirements.
    # To utilize the example authorizer as a temporary placeholder, ensure to include the following header in your requests:

    # Header:
    # secret: v7nueFORw9jvsott1q1dwsrsFJM697moV5FBvmkopnGDO3OPLSVH

    # Remember, security is paramount. This placeholder serves as a guide to help you understand the kind of information your custom authorizer should authenticate. 
    # Please replace it with your secure, proprietary logic before going live. Happy coding!
