Lambda Forge is a powerful and flexible open-source framework written in Python designed to streamline the creation, management, and deployment of AWS Lambda functions. Built with ease of use and scalability in mind, Lambda Forge empowers developers to focus on writing code while automating the tedious aspects of serverless application management.

## Features

### CLI
Lambda Forge comes with a CLI tool named `FORGE`, designed to facilitate the creation and management of resources related to serverless projects.

### Easy Creation of Lambda Functions
Easily create Lambda functions within a modular and scalable architecture, following the Single Responsibility Principle and Dependency Injection.

### Creation of Authorizers
Effortlessly create authorizers to secure access to your Lambda functions.

### AWS Resource Management
Lambda Forge encapsulates several AWS services, providing dedicated classes to handle specific responsibilities. Each class is injected into Lambda functions to facilitate interaction with AWS resources.

### Lambda Layers
Lambda Forge simplifies working with Lambda Layers, whether they are external libraries or custom code created by the developer. It automatically installs custom code in the virtual environment as if it were an external library.

### Live Development
Lambda Forge deploys real AWS resources and connects them to your local environment, enabling hot reload and easy debugging of your Lambda functions.
