# Tailoring AWS CodePipeline with CodeBuild Steps

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool that automates the steps required to release a new version of software. It connects directly to a GitHub repository, or other version control systems, to monitor for any changes in the codebase. Upon detecting changes, the pipeline automatically triggers a series of predefined steps that can include building the code, running tests, and deploying the code to various environments.

The CodeBuild step within the pipeline is crucial, since it is the component that actually compiles the source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages. Each step ensures that only code that passes all defined quality checks and tests is moved forward in the pipeline, leading towards deployment.

## AWS CodeBuild

In AWS CodeBuild, you have the flexibility to choose from a variety of setup options for your build environment. You can opt for AWS-managed images that come pre-equipped with tools for popular development environments, utilize a custom Docker image hosted on Amazon ECR or any other registry to tailor your environment to specific requirements, or precisely orchestrate your build steps through a `buildspec.yml` file. Each method is designed to cater to diverse project needs, offering everything from convenience to extensive customization, with Docker images providing the greatest scope for personalization.

To simplify setting up CodeBuild projects, we've prepared a public Docker image hosted on ECR. This image is pre-configured with all the necessary tools and includes custom Python scripts for validation and docs generation, streamlining your workflow. You can access our optimized build environment here: [https://gallery.ecr.aws/x8r4y7j7/lambda-forge](https://gallery.ecr.aws/x8r4y7j7/lambda-forge).

For those interested in customizing further, you're encouraged to use this image as a foundation to build your own project-specific private image. The necessary steps and configurations can be found in the Dockerfile provided below.

## Default Steps

As previously mentioned, the public image we used to create the container includes some python scripts that can be utilized as steps in your local projects. Whether you choose to use them is entirely up to you. Each step is defined in the `infra/steps/__init__.py` file.

The table below exemplifies the functionality of each step.

## Custom Steps

Lambda Forge enables you to design custom pipeline steps, allowing you to create proprietary scripts for validating your specific requirements.

For example, let's craft a simple custom script that traverses each file listed in the `functions.json` file. This script will trigger an error if it detects a `# TODO` comment, halting the pipeline to ensure that no pending tasks are overlooked.

Let's create a new file at `infra/scripts/validate_todo.py`:

```python title="infra/scripts/validate_todo.py"
import json
import os

def check_functions_for_todo(json_file):
    
    functions = json.load(open(json_file, 'r'))
    
    for function in functions:
        path = function.get("path", "")
        with open(path, 'r') as file:
            if '# TODO' in file.read():
                raise ValueError(f"TODO found in file: {path}")

    print("No TODO found in any files.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    json_file_path = "functions.json"
    check_functions_for_todo(json_file_path)
```

In the upcoming section, we'll dive into the seamless integration of these steps into our multi-stage pipelines, unlocking a world of possibilities for streamlining our deployment processes.
